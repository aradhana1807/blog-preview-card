## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

Hover focused state when the blog title is hovered, the card is scaled up.

```css
.container {
  box-shadow: 10px 10px 0px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 1);
  transition: all 0.2s ease-in-out;
}

.container:hover {
  box-shadow: 15px 15px 0px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 1);
}
```

### Useful resources
